title: "Perceptual learning for clinical populations with visual deficits after stroke"

excerpt: 'There are limited treatments for individuals who experience a loss of visual function as a result of a stroke.
Yet, it is reported approximately 60 per cent of stroke survivors will have a permanent visual impairment.
Recent research indicates that the visual system can learn new information, and improvements in perception
are observed as a result of training. Perceptual training, therefore, may be a potential tool for visual
rehabilitation. However, the rehabilitation of the visual areas through perceptual learning is a controversial
topic, as it is still not yet fully understood where learning is taking place, and what, exactly, is being learned.'
