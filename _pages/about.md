I am a Lecturer in Psychology in the Essex Pathways Department at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk).  

and, a final year PhD student working with [Professor Paul Hibbard](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=3193) and [Dr Loes van Dam](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=4959) in the Department of Psychology at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk).



I am currently working on my PhD thesis, which is titled "Plasticity in the Visual Cortex". I am investigating perceptual learning using psychophysical methods and specifically interested in the interaction between learning and the presence (or absence) of trial by trial feedback.  

## Other Research Interests
* Linear and Non-Linear Mixed Effects Models
* Metacognition in Learning
* Perceptual differences in Migraine
* Perceptual learning of depth 
* Virtual and Augmented reality
* Re-entrant connections (feedback connections) in the visual cortex
